## Landing Page Design Highlights

- **Dynamic Gradient Background** – the hero section features a dark gradient backdrop with a radial red glow and dotted pattern overlay.
- **Animated Floating Blobs** – translucent red blobs animate around the screen using Framer Motion for subtle movement.
- **Animated Hero Content** – headings, sub‑text and buttons fade and slide in with staggered animations.
- **Gradient CTA Button** – main call‑to‑action uses a red gradient button that scales on hover.
- **Optional Video Button** – a secondary outline style button can link to a video.
- **Statistics Grid** – animated numbers show stats below the hero text.
- **Diagonal Divider** – the bottom of the hero section ends with a diagonal SVG divider.

The rest of the site uses Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for smooth transitions.
